This thesis is dedicated to my whole family (except Kevin) and also to the guy that refills the coffee capsules\footnote{\email{a.person@epfl.ch}, Institute of Physics, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.}.

Furthermore, this thesis was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and drug money.
